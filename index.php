      <h1>Determination of motivation</h1>

      <p>Motivation is a multi-level concept. Even the blinking of the brain requires motivation, not to mention the motivation to get involved in
         semi-annual projects. As the actions are invested in each other, so are the investments and motivations. The motivation to talk with a
         colleague is invested in the motivation to better understand the task that is invested in the motivation to qualitatively cope with the
         functional for which you are responsible, which in turn is part of the motivation in time and in due quality to release the product. Lower
         levels of motivation are necessary for the existence of the upper levels, but the upper levels also support the lower ones. For example, if
         you love the product, this gives you an extra reason to take care of the quality of the task, even if you do not like it.</p>
